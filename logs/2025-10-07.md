# Development Log - October 7, 2025

## Session 1: Project Initialization

### Goals
1. Update project plan with configuration file support
2. Create project structure (plans/, archive/, logs/)
3. Break down plan into phase-based files
4. Initialize Go project

### Completed
- ✅ Updated plan.md to include configuration file design principle
- ✅ Updated plan.md with config/ package in project layout
- ✅ Added Phase 0 for project setup in development plan
- ✅ Updated translate command documentation with config-based usage
- ✅ Created project folder structure (plans/, archive/, logs/)
- ✅ Created phase-based planning files:
  - phase-0-setup.md (Project initialization)
  - phase-1-parsing.md (Core parser + listempty)
  - phase-2-searching.md (Search commands)
  - phase-3-translation.md (Translation merging)
  - phase-4-documentation.md (Docs + LLM integration)

### Key Decisions
- Configuration file will support both YAML and JSON formats
- Config path precedence: `./poflow.yml` → `~/.config/poflow/config.yml`
- Using Cobra for CLI framework and Viper for config management
- Primary usage: `poflow translate --language sv translations.txt`
- Config resolves paths: `{gettext_path}/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/default.po`

### Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Go module
- [ ] Set up basic Cobra CLI structure
- [ ] Implement config file loading with Viper
- [ ] Create initial project structure (cmd/, internal/)

### Notes
- Original plan was stateless (stdin/stdout only)
- Updated to be config-driven for easier workflow
- Config allows automatic .po file path resolution by language code
- Maintains flexibility with direct file path option as fallback

## Session 2: Phase 1 Implementation - Core Parsing + listempty

### Goals
- Implement streaming .po file parser
- Create listempty command
- Add JSON output support
- Write comprehensive tests

### Completed
- ✅ Created/verified MsgEntry struct in internal/model/entry.go
- ✅ Implemented streaming parser in internal/parser/po.go
  - Handles multi-line strings
  - Handles escaped quotes (\\n, \\t, \\", \\\\)
  - Parses comments and references
  - Streams entries one by one without loading entire file
- ✅ Implemented listempty command in cmd/listempty.go
  - Supports file input and stdin
  - Added --limit flag
  - Added --json output via global flag
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (8 tests, all passing)
  - Simple pairs
  - Empty translations
  - Multi-line strings
  - Comments and references
  - Escaped quotes
  - Multiple entries
  - Newline escapes
  - ParseAll convenience function
- ✅ Created test.po file for manual testing
- ✅ Updated phase-1-parsing.md status to COMPLETED

### Key Decisions

**Parser Architecture:**
- Used streaming approach with bufio.Scanner to avoid loading entire file into memory
- Iterator pattern: Next() returns one entry at a time
- State machine tracks whether currently reading msgid or msgstr
- Accumulates continuation lines (quoted strings on their own lines)

**Bug Fix:**
- Initial implementation forgot to join msgidLines into entry.MsgID
- Fixed by setting entry.MsgID when transitioning to msgstr
- Also fixed end-of-file handling to check msgidLines instead of entry.MsgID

**Command Design:**
- listempty supports both file argument and stdin
- --json flag inherited from global flags (defined in root.go)
- --limit flag allows limiting output

### Testing Results

All tests pass:
```
TestParser_SimplePair         ✓
TestParser_EmptyTranslation   ✓
TestParser_MultilineString    ✓
TestParser_WithComments       ✓
TestParser_EscapedQuotes      ✓
TestParser_MultipleEntries    ✓
TestParser_NewlineEscapes     ✓
TestParseAll                  ✓
```

Manual testing verified:
- `./poflow listempty test.po` - text output works
- `./poflow listempty --json test.po` - JSON output works
- `./poflow listempty --limit 1 test.po` - limit flag works
- `cat test.po | ./poflow listempty --json` - stdin works

### Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete! Ready to move on to Phase 2: Searching

Phase 2 will implement:
- `search` command (search msgid)
- `searchvalue` command (search msgstr)
- Regex and substring matching
- JSON output

### Notes

The parser handles all the key requirements:
- Multi-line strings (empty msgid followed by continuation lines)
- Escape sequences (\\n, \\t, \\", \\\\)
- Comments (# prefix)
- Reference comments (#: prefix)
- Blank line separation between entries
- Files without trailing blank lines

The streaming approach means poflow can handle large .po files efficiently without memory issues.
