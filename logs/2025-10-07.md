# Development Log - October 7, 2025

## Session 1: Project Initialization

### Goals
1. Update project plan with configuration file support
2. Create project structure (plans/, archive/, logs/)
3. Break down plan into phase-based files
4. Initialize Go project

### Completed
- ✅ Updated plan.md to include configuration file design principle
- ✅ Updated plan.md with config/ package in project layout
- ✅ Added Phase 0 for project setup in development plan
- ✅ Updated translate command documentation with config-based usage
- ✅ Created project folder structure (plans/, archive/, logs/)
- ✅ Created phase-based planning files:
  - phase-0-setup.md (Project initialization)
  - phase-1-parsing.md (Core parser + listempty)
  - phase-2-searching.md (Search commands)
  - phase-3-translation.md (Translation merging)
  - phase-4-documentation.md (Docs + LLM integration)

### Key Decisions
- Configuration file will support both YAML and JSON formats
- Config path precedence: `./poflow.yml` → `~/.config/poflow/config.yml`
- Using Cobra for CLI framework and Viper for config management
- Primary usage: `poflow translate --language sv translations.txt`
- Config resolves paths: `{gettext_path}/{lang}/LC_MESSAGES/default.po`

### Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Go module
- [ ] Set up basic Cobra CLI structure
- [ ] Implement config file loading with Viper
- [ ] Create initial project structure (cmd/, internal/)

### Notes
- Original plan was stateless (stdin/stdout only)
- Updated to be config-driven for easier workflow
- Config allows automatic .po file path resolution by language code
- Maintains flexibility with direct file path option as fallback
