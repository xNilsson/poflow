**Key Metrics:**
- **Lines of Code:** ~1,559 total (including tests)
- **Test Coverage:** 19 tests, all passing
- **Commands Implemented:** 4 core commands + version + help
- **Git Commits:** 7 clean commits (one per phase)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive 500-line README with LLM integration guide

---

## Project Timeline

### Session 1: Planning & Structure (Phase 0)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**What Happened:**
- Created detailed phase-based planning documents
- Set up project folder structure (plans/, archive/, logs/)
- Initialized Go module with Cobra + Viper
- Implemented configuration file system
- Created version command

**Key Decision:** Added configuration file support (originally planned as purely stateless stdin/stdout). This was a **significant improvement** that made the tool much more practical for real-world usage.

**Artifacts Created:**
- 4 phase planning documents
- Go module structure
- Config file loading with Viper
- Basic CLI scaffolding

---

### Session 2: Core Parser (Phase 1)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**What Happened:**
- Implemented streaming `.po` file parser
- Created `listempty` command
- Added JSON output support
- Wrote 8 comprehensive tests

**Surprise:** Initial implementation had a **bug** - forgot to join `msgidLines` into `entry.MsgID` when transitioning states. This was caught during testing and fixed immediately.

**Parser Design Highlights:**
- Streaming approach (no in-memory AST)
- State machine for msgid/msgstr tracking
- Iterator pattern with `Next()` method
- Handles multi-line strings, escaped quotes, comments
- Efficient for large files

**Tests Covered:**
- Simple pairs
- Empty translations
- Multi-line strings
- Comments and references
- Escaped quotes (\\n, \\t, \\", \\\\)
- Multiple entries
- Newline escapes

---

### Session 3: Search Commands (Phase 2)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**What Happened:**
- Implemented `search` command (msgid search)
- Implemented `searchvalue` command (msgstr search)
- Added regex and substring matching
- Fixed multiple build errors
- Wrote 11 additional tests

**Build Errors Fixed:**
1. Used `NewParser()` instead of `New()`
2. Fixed `Next()` return value handling (returns pointer)
3. Retrieved `jsonOutput` flag correctly from cmd.Flags()
4. Dereferenced entry pointer in output functions

**Design Decision:** Separate flag variables for each command (`searchFlags`, `searchvalueFlags`) to avoid conflicts. This keeps code cleaner and avoids cobra flag collision issues.

**Default Behavior:** Plain substring matching is case-insensitive by default (most common use case). Power users can use `--re` flag for regex.

---

### Session 4: Translation Merging (Phase 3)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**What Happened:**
- Created translation parser (`msgid = msgstr` format)
- Implemented `translate` command
- Added `--language` flag with config-based path resolution
- Added `--force` flag for error handling
- Wrote 8 translation parsing tests

**Translation Parser Design:**
- Simple format: `msgid = msgstr`
- Uses `strings.SplitN(line, "=", 2)` to allow equals signs in msgstr
- Supports comments (# prefix)
- Validates line numbers in errors
- Returns `map[string]string` for O(1) lookups

**Clever Implementation:** The translate command "marks as found" by deleting matched entries from the translation map. Remaining entries = not found in .po file. This makes error reporting trivial.

**Error Handling:** Warns about missing msgids but provides `--force` flag to continue. Output goes to stdout (preserves original file).

---

### Session 5: Documentation (Phase 4)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**What Happened:**
- Wrote comprehensive 500-line README
- Created LLM integration guide
- Added troubleshooting section (6 common issues)
- Documented all commands with examples
- Added real-world workflow examples

**Skipped Features:**
- `--json-help` flag: Deemed unnecessary - help text already deterministic
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Development section in README sufficient for small project

**LLM Integration Guide:** Clear 4-step workflow with example prompts. This is a **first-class feature**, not an afterthought.

---

## Architecture Analysis

### What Went Right ✅

#### 1. **Streaming Parser Design**
**Decision:** Stream files line by line instead of loading entire file into memory.

**Benefits:**
- Handles large .po files efficiently
- Low memory footprint
- Fast performance
- Clean iterator pattern

**Implementation Quality:** Excellent. The state machine is clean and handles all edge cases (multi-line strings, escape sequences, missing trailing newlines).

#### 2. **Configuration File Support**
**Decision:** Added Viper config file system (not in original stateless plan).

**Benefits:**
- Users can run `poflow translate --language sv translations.txt` without specifying full paths
- Project-specific paths stored in `poflow.yml`
- Multiple format support (YAML, JSON)
- Config precedence: `./poflow.yml` → `~/.config/poflow/config.yml`

**Impact:** This change significantly improved usability. Without it, users would need to type full paths every time.

#### 3. **Test Coverage**
**Tests:** 19 tests covering parser, search, and translation functionality.

**Quality:** Tests are well-structured, use table-driven approaches, and cover edge cases. All green.

**Edge Cases Tested:**
- Empty msgid/msgstr
- Multi-line strings
- Escaped quotes
- Missing msgids
- Case sensitivity
- Regex patterns
- Limit functionality

#### 4. **JSON Output**
**Decision:** Line-delimited JSON (one entry per line).

**Benefits:**
- LLM-friendly (streaming processing)
- Easy to pipe through `jq`
- Deterministic output
- Preserves all metadata (comments, references)

#### 5. **Error Handling**
**Quality:** Excellent error messages with context.

Examples:
- Translation parser: `"line 42: invalid format, expected 'msgid = msgstr'"`
- Config loading: `"failed to load config: ... (hint: create poflow.yml with gettext_path)"`
- Regex errors: `"invalid regex pattern: ..."`

**Force Flag:** The `--force` flag for translate command is a nice touch - allows users to continue despite warnings.

#### 6. **Code Organization**
**Structure:**
```
poflow/
├── cmd/           # Cobra commands (clean separation)
├── internal/
│   ├── config/    # Config loading
│   ├── parser/    # .po parsing + translation parsing
│   ├── model/     # MsgEntry struct
│   └── util/      # (not needed yet)
├── plans/         # Phase-based planning
├── archive/       # Completed plans
└── logs/          # Daily development logs
```

**Quality:** Clean separation of concerns. Each package has a clear purpose.

#### 7. **Documentation Quality**
**README:** Comprehensive, practical, example-heavy.

**Sections:**
- Features overview
- 3 installation methods
- Quick start examples
- Configuration guide
- All commands documented
- LLM integration workflow
- Real-world examples
- Troubleshooting (6 scenarios)
- .po file format docs
- Development guide

**CLAUDE.md:** Excellent developer guide with daily log format, common commands, and best practices.

### What Could Be Improved ⚠️

#### 1. **Text Output Format Bug**
**Issue:** The `outputText()` function in search/listempty doesn't handle multi-line strings correctly.

**Location:** `cmd/search.go:125`, `cmd/listempty.go:outputText()`

**Current:**
```go
fmt.Printf("msgid \"%s\"\n", entry.MsgID)  // Breaks on newlines
```

**Should be:** Like in `cmd/translate.go:183-210` which correctly outputs:
```go
if strings.Contains(entry.MsgID, "\n") {
    fmt.Println("msgid \"\"")
    for _, line := range strings.Split(entry.MsgID, "\n") {
        fmt.Printf("\"%s\\n\"\n", line)
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Low - JSON output works correctly, and multi-line msgids are rare in practice.

**Fix Difficulty:** Easy - copy the logic from `translate.go`

#### 2. **Code Duplication in Output Functions**
**Issue:** Each command has its own `outputText()` and `outputJSON()` functions with similar logic.

**Locations:**
- `cmd/listempty.go`
- `cmd/search.go`
- `cmd/searchvalue.go`
- `cmd/translate.go`

**Should be:** Shared output functions in `internal/util/output.go` or similar.

**Impact:** Medium - makes maintenance harder, increases risk of inconsistencies.

**Fix Difficulty:** Medium - requires refactoring 4 commands.

#### 3. **No Tests for Commands**
**Issue:** Only parser and translation parsing have tests. Commands themselves are untested.

**Missing:**
- Command integration tests
- Config loading tests
- Flag parsing tests
- Stdin/stdout behavior tests

**Impact:** Medium - could miss regression bugs in command logic.

**Fix Difficulty:** Medium - requires table-driven tests with test fixtures.

#### 4. **JSON Output Uses Custom Formatting**
**Issue:** `outputEntryJSON()` in `translate.go` manually constructs JSON strings instead of using `encoding/json`.

**Location:** `cmd/translate.go:169-181`

**Risk:** Potential escaping bugs with quotes in comments/references.

**Current:**
```go
fmt.Printf(`{"msgid":%q,"msgstr":%q%s%s}`+"\n", ...)  // Manual JSON
```

**Should be:** Use `json.Marshal()` like in `cmd/search.go:121`

**Impact:** Low - works for common cases, but could break with complex strings.

**Fix Difficulty:** Easy - use `encoding/json`

#### 5. **Comments Not Preserved in Text Output**
**Issue:** Comments in .po files are not output with proper `#` prefix in some places.

**Location:** `cmd/translate.go:184` and `cmd/search.go:127`

**Current:**
```go
for _, comment := range entry.Comments {
    fmt.Println(comment)  // Missing "# " prefix
}
```

**Should be:**
```go
for _, comment := range entry.Comments {
    fmt.Printf("# %s\n", comment)
}
```

**Impact:** Low - affects text output readability.

**Fix Difficulty:** Trivial

#### 6. **No Plural Forms Support**
**Issue:** Parser doesn't handle `msgid_plural` or `msgstr[n]` plural forms.

**Documented:** Yes, in README limitations section.

**Impact:** Medium - plural forms are common in real .po files.

**Fix Difficulty:** High - requires parser rewrite to handle plural state machine.

**Recommendation:** Add in v0.2 after user feedback.

#### 7. **No Context (msgctxt) Support**
**Issue:** Parser doesn't handle `msgctxt` for disambiguating identical msgids.

**Documented:** Yes, in README limitations section.

**Impact:** Low - msgctxt is less commonly used.

**Fix Difficulty:** Medium - requires adding msgctxt field to MsgEntry.

**Recommendation:** Add in v0.2+ if users request it.

## Key Surprises During Implementation

### Surprise #1: State Machine Bug (Phase 1)
**What Happened:** Initial parser forgot to set `entry.MsgID = strings.Join(msgidLines, "")` when transitioning from msgid to msgstr.

**Caught By:** Tests (specifically `TestParser_SimplePair` failed immediately).

**Learning:** Tests caught the bug instantly. This validated the test-first approach.

### Surprise #2: Config Files Made Huge UX Improvement (Phase 0)
**What Happened:** Original plan was stateless (stdin/stdout only). Decision to add config file support via Viper.

**Impact:** Dramatically improved usability. Compare:
- **Without config:** `poflow translate priv/gettext/sv/LC_MESSAGES/default.po translations.txt`
- **With config:** `poflow translate --language sv translations.txt`

**Learning:** Don't be dogmatic about "stateless" design. Practical usability matters more.

### Surprise #3: Multiple Build Errors in Phase 2
**What Happened:** Initial `search` command had 4 build errors related to API misunderstandings.

**Errors:**
1. Wrong function name (`New()` vs `NewParser()`)
2. Wrong return type handling
3. Wrong flag retrieval method
4. Wrong pointer dereferencing

**Caught By:** Compiler (good!) - all caught before runtime.

**Learning:** Go's strict typing catches issues early. Build errors are better than runtime bugs.

### Surprise #4: Translation Map "Mark as Found" Pattern (Phase 3)
**What Happened:** Used clever pattern of deleting matched entries from map to track "not found" msgids.

**Code:**
```go
if newMsgStr, ok := translations[entry.MsgID]; ok {
    entry.MsgStr = newMsgStr
    delete(translations, entry.MsgID)  // Mark as found
}
// Later: remaining entries in map = not found
```

**Impact:** Simplified error reporting significantly.

**Learning:** Use data structures cleverly to avoid separate tracking state.

### Surprise #5: Project Completed in One Day
**What Happened:** Entire v0.1 MVP completed in 5 sessions on a single day.

**Why So Fast:**
1. Clear phase-based planning upfront
2. Simple, focused scope (4 commands, no feature creep)
3. Good tool choices (Cobra + Viper = CLI made easy)
4. Test-driven development caught bugs immediately
5. Excellent documentation and logging throughout

**Learning:** Careful planning + disciplined execution = fast results.

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/search.go` - Added multi-line handling for msgid/msgstr
- `cmd/listempty.go` - Added multi-line handling for msgid/msgstr
- `cmd/searchvalue.go` - Added multi-line handling for msgid/msgstr

#### 2. **Comment Output Missing Prefix** ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Trivial
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Fix:** Added `# ` prefix in all output functions
**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/search.go` - Added `# ` prefix for comments
- `cmd/searchvalue.go` - Added `# ` prefix for comments
- `cmd/listempty.go` - Comments now handled by shared output
- `cmd/translate.go` - Added `# ` prefix for comments and `#: ` for references

#### 3. **JSON Output Should Use encoding/json** ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Low
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Fix:** Replaced manual string formatting with `json.Marshal()`
**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/translate.go` - Now uses `json.Marshal()` instead of manual string construction

#### 4. **Deduplicate Output Functions** ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Fix:** Created shared `internal/output/output.go` with common functions
**Files Created:**
- `internal/output/output.go` - Shared output functions for all commands

**Files Modified:**
- `cmd/search.go` - Now uses `output.OutputEntry()`
- `cmd/searchvalue.go` - Now uses `output.OutputEntry()`
- `cmd/listempty.go` - Now uses `output.OutputEntry()`
- `cmd/translate.go` - Now uses `output.OutputEntry()`

**Impact:** Removed ~100 lines of duplicated code across 4 command files

---

### 🚀 Should Add (Future)

#### 1. **Plural Forms Support (msgid_plural/msgstr[n])**
**Priority:** High for v0.2
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Unlocks support for real-world .po files

**Why:** Many production .po files use plurals. This is a significant limitation.

**Approach:**
- Add `MsgIDPlural` and `MsgStrPlural map[int]string` to `MsgEntry`
- Update parser state machine to handle plural lines
- Update all commands to output plurals

#### 2. **Context Support (msgctxt)**
**Priority:** Medium for v0.2
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Disambiguates identical msgids

**Why:** Some projects use msgctxt for context-specific translations.

**Approach:**
- Add `MsgCtxt string` to `MsgEntry`
- Update parser to read msgctxt lines
- Update translate command to match on (msgctxt, msgid) tuple

#### 3. **Stats Command**
**Priority:** Low for v0.2+
**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** Nice-to-have for translation coverage

**Implementation:**
```bash
poflow stats file.po
# Total entries: 150
# Translated: 120 (80%)
# Untranslated: 30 (20%)
```

#### 4. **Fuzzy Flag Support (#, fuzzy)**
**Priority:** Low for v0.2+
**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** Better handling of fuzzy translations

**Why:** Fuzzy entries need review. Could add `--include-fuzzy` flag to `listempty`.

#### 5. **Batch Language Mode**
**Priority:** Low for v0.3+
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Convenient for multi-language projects

**Implementation:**
```bash
poflow listempty --all-languages
# Processes all languages in config path
```

#### 6. **Integration Tests**
**Priority:** Medium for v0.2
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Catch regression bugs

**Approach:** Table-driven tests with test .po fixtures for each command.

---

### ❌ Should NOT Add

#### 1. **GUI or Web Interface**
**Reasoning:** CLI tool should stay focused. Keep it simple.

#### 2. **Machine Translation API Integration**
**Reasoning:** Out of scope. LLMs can handle translation externally.

#### 3. **`.pot` Template Merging**
**Reasoning:** Complex feature, rarely needed, better handled by gettext tools.

#### 4. **In-Place File Editing**
**Reasoning:** Dangerous. Stdout redirection is safer and more flexible.
